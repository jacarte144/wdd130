                    <h4>This is a very specific site and visitors who want to visit this site are likely looking for help or instruction on how to make their own storage device or want to look at examples to see if it is something that they would be interested in. For something like this, the visitors likely are browsing multiple sites and looking for whatever information they can find on the subject and my site will have pictures of finished products and clear explanations of how they are able to replicate this process themselves. Even if they are looking into other sites, my site will continually draw them back in as it will be easy to access and get quick</h4>

                    <h4>3D printers take software and materials and combine them with very precise lasers in order to print a 3D model designated within the software. The software is used to indicate what you are actually wanting to print and will put in commands to make sure the laser knows how and where to print the material. The software allows the laser to pin point even the tineist of details, so that your model looks exactly as you plan. The software will tell the laser when slicing is required which is how the printer will know when to stop and start printing again as it moves vertically. There are a variety of materials that can be used to make the print such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, or carbon fiber filaments to name a couple. The process takes anywhere from a few hours for simple prints to weeks for large, detailed prints. There are different techinques that can be used and most printers will excell in a particular technique. While we use 3D printers for game components, they have many uses that are constanly expanding each year, such as 3D printing homes and medical devices.</h4>
