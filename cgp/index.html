                <p>People will come to my site because they want to look at the 3D printed game storage devices I have made, and they will want to request their own or look at how we make the devices so they can attempt to make it at home if they have their own 3D printer. It will be to help those who have an interest in the 3D printing hobby and like to play games. They will likely want to know how they can incorporate their hobbies together and my site will offer them a space to come and see that. Visitors to the site will hope to view a sample of how the storage inserts look and be able to look over FAQs about how they work and if it seems like the right product for them. They will want to be able to review lists of questions to see if it matches with their own research on this subject and help guide them to making their own products at home. They can view the current model of the week on our home page and look through pictures of how the finished products for these models look to see if it is something appealing to them for games that they own themselves.</p>
