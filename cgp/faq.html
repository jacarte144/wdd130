                <h4>My visitors will expect to have their question of how these storage devices are made? or what types of games can these storage devices work with? How does the process of 3D printing these storage devices work and will I be able to afford and replicate the process on my own? Is this something that needs to be done by only a professional? Are these specific to certain games and is it possible to do even more than just storage with these plans? My site will not be for profit, but more so instructional for visitors to see and make their own cool 3D printed devices. No personal information would be necessary at this time from visitors. Since the website does not need personal information, visitors would likely feel better about browsing the contents of the website. It could allow a place for them to put in personal input or feedback on their own products or designs or how they feel about the products and designs that we are posting from our own 3D prints</h4>
