        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to my site because they want to look at the 3D printed game storage devices I have made, and they will want to request their own or look at how we make the devices so they can attempt to make it at home if they have their own 3D printer. It will be to help those who have an interest in the 3D printing hobby and like to play games. They will likely want to know how they can incorporate their hobbies together and my site will offer them a space to come and see that. 
        Visitors to the site will hope to view a sample of how the storage inserts look and be able to look over FAQs about how they work and if it seems like the right product for them. They will want to be able to review lists of questions to see if it matches with their own research on this subject and help guide them to making their own products at home. They can view the current model of the week on our home page and look through pictures of how the finished products for these models look to see if it is something appealing to them for games that they own themselves.

      </ul>
      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        My visitors will expect to have their question of how these storage devices are made? or what types of games can these storage devices work with? How does the process of 3D printing these storage devices work and will I be able to afford and replicate the process on my own? Is this something that needs to be done by only a professional? Are these specific to certain games and is it possible to do even more than just storage with these plans?
        My site will not be for profit, but more so instructional for visitors to see and make their own cool 3D printed devices. No personal information would be necessary at this time from visitors. Since the website does not need personal information, visitors would likely feel better about browsing the contents of the website. It could allow a place for them to put in personal input or feedback on their own products or designs or how they feel about the products and designs that we are posting from our own 3D prints.

      <h3>The Printing Process</h3>
      <p>
        This is a very specific site and visitors who want to visit this site are likely looking for help or instruction on how to make their own storage device or want to look at examples to see if it is something that they would be interested in. For something like this, the visitors likely are browsing multiple sites and looking for whatever information they can find on the subject and my site will have pictures of finished products and clear explanations of how they are able to replicate this process themselves. Even if they are looking into other sites, my site will continually draw them back in as it will be easy to access and get quick
