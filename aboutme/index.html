    <h2>Jake Carter</h2>
    <p> I am currently working towards a bachelors degree in business management. I love board games and get together with friends to play new games every couple of weeks we usually like to back a bunch of different kickstarters and have new games to try fairly often. I am married with 1 daughter. I am a stay at home dad. 
        I also enjoy movies A LOT and typically enjoy sci-fi and horror the most. My wife hates horror and I hope one day my daughter will be my horror movie buddy.

        I love how accesible BYUI is for me in the pathway program.
        Learning about web design opens up the doors to many options, wether it is personal or for other businesses.
        I have been a member of the LDS church my whole life! I have always been in the church, as has my wife, and have been very blessed to be a part of the ward I was in growing up, which helped me to gain many friends and loved ones I know I can count on.
